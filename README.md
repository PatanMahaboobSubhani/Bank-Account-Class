# Bank-Account-Class
This task is evaluated using an AI-based evaluator called "AI-Mentor" that follows strict rubrics and deterministic logic. Every code submission is assessed based on the following principles:

1. Rule-Based Feedback: All feedbacks are derived using binary checks (Yes/No) against a predefined rubric.
2. Objective Evaluation: No subjective or random interpretation is applied.
3. Fair Feedback: The AI provides one of four fixed feedback outcomes (Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement, Unsatisfactory).

# AI Disclaimer:
While the evaluation logic is deterministic, AI may occasionally misinterpret code or generate imprecise feedback (commonly known as hallucination). If you believe your score or feedback is inaccurate, please cross-check your solution with the rubric and resubmit after improvements.
